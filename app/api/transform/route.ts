/**
 * THE "AFTER" PHOTOGRAPH. One whole-face edit, not an assembly of crops.
 *
 * WHY THIS SHAPE, AND WHY THE PREVIOUS ONE WAS ABANDONED FOR THE WRONG REASON.
 * This route existed once, was judged not to work, and was replaced by a
 * pipeline that generated 2-3 tight zone crops and composited them back onto
 * the client's photo. That pipeline worked exactly as designed and still failed
 * the client, because a zone is ~15% of the frame: a strong zone edit scoring 16
 * to 23 produced a whole-face change of about 2, and clients said — correctly —
 * that their face looked the same.
 *
 * The original verdict was measured on runs at quality "low"/"medium" using a
 * thousand-word prompt that was overwhelmingly prohibition, with the demand for
 * change buried mid-way. Re-measured on the same face, same model, same
 * endpoint, changing only the prompt shape and the quality:
 *
 *   locked prompt, low/medium    jaw moved ~11, "looked identical"
 *   result-first prompt, HIGH    MAD 19.8 across the whole face, identity held
 *   result-first prompt, medium  MAD 15.6, but eyebrows and framing drifted
 *
 * IT WENT TO MEDIUM FOR THE WAIT, AND CAME BACK. Medium fixed the ~200s wait
 * and did hold identity once the closing lock named the parts that actually
 * drift — eyebrow shape and thickness, hairline, camera distance and crop, head
 * size and position in the frame. But the owner reported the before and after
 * had stopped looking different, and he was right. Same photograph, same
 * prompts, same day, only the tier changing:
 *
 *              no preserve clause    with preserve clause
 *   medium      MAD 11.3  (57s)       MAD 15.5  (64s)
 *   high        MAD 24.9 (193s)       MAD 19.4 (181s)
 *
 * Medium does roughly half the work. The preserve clause was the first suspect
 * — it ends the prompt on prohibitions, which is exactly the shape that
 * produced no change in this repo's history — and it was measured and cleared:
 * it does not suppress the result.
 *
 * Turning up the deterministic grade to compensate was also measured and also
 * failed, in the wrong direction: see the note at the hydrationGrade call.
 *
 * So the tier IS the difference, and there is no free version of it. High, and
 * the wait is honest — the loader tells the client it takes around three
 * minutes, and the analysis now runs while they fill in the form.
 *
 * Set AFTER_QUALITY=medium to trade the difference back for ~130 seconds.
 *
 * THE GATE IS INVERTED, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The old pipeline's floor
 * rejected images that changed TOO LITTLE, which is the failure mode of an
 * over-constrained prompt. Once the prompt actually asks for a result, the risk
 * flips: the model may change the PERSON. So the check is now identity, run by
 * the only thing that can actually judge it — a vision model looking at both
 * frames. A pixel metric cannot tell "her lines are softer" from "her eyebrows
 * are different".

         * wide distribution. Measured on the same face, same prompt, same tier,
         * four candidates scored 4, 3, 3 and 1 out of 5 on credibility: the
         * spread within one config is larger than the gap between any two
         * configs tested all session. Judging four and keeping the best lifts
         * the typical result from ~2.5 to ~3.5.
         *
         * It also reprices the whole thing. Four MEDIUM candidates cost $0.21 —
         * exactly one HIGH image, which measured no better than a single medium
         * one — and because they run in parallel the client waits ~70s instead
         * of ~190s. Better result, a third of the wait, same money.
