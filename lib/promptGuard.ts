/**
 * Vetting the image brief Claude writes.
 *
 * WHY A GUARD AT ALL. The per-area close-up prompt is now authored by Claude
 * during the analysis rather than assembled from a template, because Claude is
 * the only thing in the pipeline that has actually looked at the photograph and
 * can describe THIS person's skin. That is a real improvement and it also hands
 * a language model the pen on what a picture claims, so the output is checked
 * before it reaches the image API.
 *
 * TWO LISTS, NOT ONE, and the split matters more than either list's contents.
 * These are different kinds of problem and they deserve different answers:
 *
 *  - UNSAFE is a claim the clinic cannot make — erasing a mole, lightening
 *    skin. Never reaches the API. Non-negotiable.
 *  - STRUCTURE is a quality problem. Measured on this pipeline, a brief asking
 *    for skin that is "rebuilt", "firmer" or "plumped from beneath" dropped the
 *    visible change from 25.2 to 5.9: the model spends the edit trying to render
 *    something it cannot and hands back a near-identical frame.
 *
 * Both used to sit in one regex, so both got the same treatment — silent
 * rejection, silent fallback to the generic template. That was the wrong shape
 * twice over. It threw away a personalised brief over a single word, and it did
 * so with NO LOG LINE, so nobody could see how often it was happening or why
 * every client seemed to be getting the same generic edit.
 *
 * The word list was also too broad and caught ordinary skin writing:
 *   `age`      -> "age spots", a legitimate surface concern
 *   `fill*`    -> "the crease is less filled with shadow", a description of
 *                 light, not of dermal filler
 *   `remove*`  -> only a claim when it has a FEATURE as its object, so it is now
 *                 matched against one rather than banned outright
 * Each of those forced a real brief back to the template for no benefit.
 */

/**
 * Word-boundaried at BOTH ends, and that is load-bearing rather than tidiness:
